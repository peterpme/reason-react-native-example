# Reason React Native Example

I created this repo as an demo for my [First PR with ReasonML](https://medium.com/@peterpme/your-first-reasonml-pr-into-an-existing-react-native-codebase-a490b4a79649) article.

If you're having trouble getting something working, just download this and run:

```
yarn watch
```

This is an Expo project so within terminal you can run: `exp start`
